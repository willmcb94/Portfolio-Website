# Will McBurney Portfolio Website

This is a website I've built since completing the Northcoder's fullstack developer bootcamp.
I built it with the intention to display the work I completed during the course. I will also continue
to add personal projects to the site as and when they are completed.

The site was built using HTML, CSS, Next.js and hosted with Netlify.
